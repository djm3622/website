## Abstract

This project introduces a novel approach for operator-guided diffusion in time-invariant systems. The work bridges numerical optimization techniques and deep learning methods to enhance stability and efficiency.

---

## Methodology

Our approach involves a combination of Koopman operator theory and guided diffusion processes. The core architecture integrates U-Net structures for accurate prediction and improved operator inference.

---

## Results

Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to traditional methods, with improvements in runtime and prediction accuracy.
